# prnt.sc-scraper
* This repo will allow you to scrape images from the prnt.sc website as they have predictable subheadings we can freely attempt to download random images in a sequential order from a specified amount to a max limit in a folder. This is a security issue from their end as I've seen many private information that could easily be stolen if found by the wrong people.

* When setting this up make sure you have a file called "Images" in the same directory as the main file.
